My own journey toward language was sparked in 1996 when I discovered Keith Basso’s
astonishing book Wisdom Sits in Places. Writing about the unique place-making language of the
Western Apache, Basso described language in a way that I’d never considered before, as roots
and fragments strung together to sing of the land. This idea intrigued me so much that I began
carrying Donald Borror’s classic little book, the Dictionary of Word Roots and Combining Forms,
with me on all my hikes (a practice which I’ve continued on a daily basis for nearly twenty years
and on thousands of miles of trails) in order to learn the meaning and origin of word elements at
the moment they occurred to me while walking in wild landscapes.
For many years this seemed little more than a quirky hobby, with no real intent or direction, but
then a friend introduced me to Calvert Watkins’s magisterial survey of Indo-European
poetics, How to Kill a Dragon. In a flash I realized that there might be untapped ways for the
English language to speak of the magic of the land and the depths of the human spirit, so I began 
a four-year quest to read every book I could find on the history, formation, and word-making
processes of the English language.
What you hold here is the result of my investigation: 76 sections that explore some of the many
pieces and processes that have gone into shaping the English language as we use it today. As I
researched and wrote each section of this book I carried these ideas with me on long hikes in wild
places and held them up against the natural world to see which ideas resonated and which ideas
took on a life of their own. This book emerges from and reflects these hikes, and because I also
lead walks as a naturalist in my professional life this book is modeled on the metaphysic that I
know best—the flow of ideas and observations that arise spontaneously when humans encounter
the world with curiosity and wonder.
